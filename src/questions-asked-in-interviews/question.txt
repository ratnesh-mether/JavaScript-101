Question 1
You have been given an array of integers. Your task is to write a function that finds the largest sum of three consecutive elements in the array using a sliding window approach. In other words, you need to scan through the array by considering three consecutive elements at a time, calculating their sum, and then moving the window forward by one element. Your function should return both the largest sum and the three elements that contribute to that sum.
Here is an example to illustrate the problem:
Given the array: [1, 2, 3, -9, -8, -12, -22, 1, 3, 9, 21, 3, 2, 4, 23]
The function should output:
Largest Sum: 33 (which corresponds to the sum of elements 21, 3, 9)
Elements: [21, 3, 9]


Question 2-


You have been given an array of integers. Your task is to write a function that finds the Smallest sum of three consecutive elements in the array using a sliding window approach. In other words, you need to scan through the array by considering three consecutive elements at a time, calculating their sum, and then moving the window forward by one element. Your function should return both the largest sum and the three elements that contribute to that sum.
Here is an example to illustrate the problem:
Given the array: [1, 2, 3, -9, -8, -12, -22, 1, 3, 9, 21, 3, 2, 4, 23]
 








Question 3-


You have been provided with a three-dimensional array containing integers. Your task is to write a function that converts this 3D array into a two-dimensional array by flattening it, while preserving the order of the elements.
Here's an example to help you understand the problem:
Given the 3D array:
[
    [[1, 2], [3, 4]],
    [[5, 6], [7, 8]],
    [[9, 10], [11, 12]]
]
 


Output-
[
    [1, 2],
    [3, 4],
    [5, 6],
    [7, 8],
    [9, 10],
    [11, 12]
]
